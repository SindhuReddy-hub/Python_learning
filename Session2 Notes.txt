compilor: will take all the code as one line and start running so execution is fast

print("hi")
print("123") both lines run at one

Features of Python:

1. Interpreted language: means executed line by line instead of block which reults on delay in execution

example: print("hi")
prnt("123") single lines run at one


ouput: 
hi
Nameerror: name prnt is not defined

2. Dynamically type: we no need to specify the data type before using any data

example: sindhu
other lannguages: str sindhu


3. Cross platform language: used in multiple platforms(OS) like windows, mac,linus

4. General Purpose Language: used python with any other technology(integrate with any other languages like vb script, R, sql,ML)



String --- collections of characters

single letter is not a string 

variable ----container (example waterbottle store something)

a=10


**************

Variable can start with underscore (_) symbol
_var=100

we cannot start a number with variable

2var=100

invalid syntax

var2=800

no error


We cannot give spaces between two words in a variables

abd def=100

wrong

correct: abc_def or abcdef
